    <h1>Tracking Crime in Boston</h1>
    <h2>Marcos Equiza Gasco, Dylan Toplas, Sydney Schulz, Kevin Martone</h2>
    <h3>General Introduction</h3>

    <p>Boston is a dynamic city known for its many college campuses. As a result, the demographics
      change drastically as college students come and go throughout the year. These changes affect the
      general demographics and environment of the city, but we are looking to discover how the
      changes in the time of year affect crime throughout the city. By examining the location, time, and
      offense of a crime and comparing it with different neighborhoods, we can discover how
      different features affect crime in the city. By allowing students and Boston
      residents to examine crime in their neighborhoods, they can better understand the safety of where
      they live and how they may be affected by the changing seasons.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Introduction</h3>

    <p>For our analysis we will be utilizing a <a href="https://boston-pd-crime-hub-boston.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/boston::boston-police-incidents-/explore">dataset</a> found on the Boston Police Data Hub and is free to
      download for anyone online. The data is broken down into 21 features and approximately
      212,000 rows. Some of these features are extractions from others, as the column for month data
      of a crime can also be found in the column containing date-time objects for crimes. However,
      most of the columns do contain useful/unique information. The majority of the data is
      categorical in nature, with the main outlier being datetime. This is largely due to the nature of
      crime data, as the focus is mainly on frequency which is not a continuous datapoint. A major
      reason we are using this dataset is also for its location information. The dataset includes the zip
      code, street address, and district for a vast majority of the points. This will allow us to create
      interesting spatial graphics later on.
    </p>

    <h3>Interactive Neighborhood Map</h3>

    <p>To have a general understanding of the data, we made an interactive map so 
      people can have an awareness of the concentration of crime in their neighborhoods.
      Throughout the years, there is a seemingly common pattern of the neighborhoods
      with the most crimes, wih Roxbury and Dorchestor with the highest incidence.
      Additionally, the different T lines are mapped over the neighborhoods to assess
      whether there is any correlation. There seems to be a higher incidence in neighborhoods close 
      to the red T line, closely followed by the orange line.

    <h3>Sankey Diagram</h3>

      <div class='text'>
        <p>This is a Sankey diagram showing neighborhood crime flows. The diagram shows the top 
          five most common crime committed and how often they occur in the top three 
          neighborhoods with the most instances of crime being committed. In this plot,
          it is obvious that Dorchester has by far the greatest number of crimes that 
           have been committed of the eight most common crimes. The two next neighborhoods 
           have far fewer crimes that are committed. It is also apparant that some of
            the most common crimes are verbal disputes and assault. It appears as if the 
            crimes are mostly proportionally split through the neighborhoods.
        </p>

    <h3>Altair Interactive Line Chart</h3>

    <p>In order to understand the trends of crimes over time, we created an interactive
      line chart that displays crime trends over a two year period followed by the 
      a concentration of criems over that period. Based on the graph, it is obvious that 
      the for each crime, the number of crimes over each month jumps up and down. For example,
      the number of vandalism crimes were high in August 2022 and then dropped lower in September
      2022.

      </div>
      <div class='text'>
        <p>We also studied which days of the week most commonly result in crimes. This bar
          chart shows the number of crimes committed broken down by each day of the week. As 
          demonstrated on the chart, crimes occur most frequently on Friday as a total of 32,000
          crimes were committed on Friday. To contrast, approximately 28,000 crimes occured on
          Sunday, the day when the lowest number of crimes were committed. Interestingly, Saturday
          is not on the lower or higher end of the spectrum which suggests that weekends vs 
          weekdays have no impact on the amount of crimes committed. Rather the day of the week as
          an independent value is the most significant factor.

              This bar chart shows which neighborhoods contain the most amount of crimes. It contains
              26 neighborhoods in Boston and the number of crimes committed in each of the neighborhoods
              As shown, Dorchester contains the vast majority of crimes committed as 50,000 crimes 
              have been committed in that neighborhood. The second most common neighborhood is Roxbury.
              In the remaining neighborhoods, there is less of a difference between the number of crimes 
              committed. The Harbor Islands have very few crimes recorded and the bar is barely apparant.
              This is partially to be expected as the Harbor Islands has a population of only 340 people
              According to <a href="https://www.niche.com/places-to-live/n/harbor-islands-boston-ma/">Niche.</a>

  <h3>Circle interactive chart</h3>

  <p>These charts showcase a further breakdown on the frequency and type of crimes.
 </p>


  <div class='container'>
    <div class = 'center'>
      <iframe src="section_of_day.html" width="550px" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  </div>
    <div class='text'>
      <p>In this chart, we are examining the breakdown of crimes committed during each month, broken
        down by the section of the day.
        We classify morning as 5 am - 12 pm, afternoon as 12 pm - 5 pm, evening as 5 pm - 9 pm,
        and night as the remaining time as well as the earlier hours before 5 am.
        In this plot, you can further dive into the data by clicking on the legend to include/exclude
        specific categories, and
        you can also hover over any of the bars to get the specific count of crimes. From this plot
        we can gather that crimes seem to be committed most frequently in the summer months of July
        and August.
        However, it also showed us that when you view only the evening timeframe, the largest
        amount of crimes are taking place during May.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>


  <div class='container'>
    <div class='text'>
      <p>Similar to the previous polar bar chart, we are examining how the count of crimes by month is
        affected when we separate the data further into
        day-of-the-week categories. Utilizing the hover data once again we were able to notice
        that a larger portion of crimes are being committed later on in the week.
        Again, there were a few outlier months that could use further examination. One example of
        this is March when the largest crime counts were closer to the center of the week.

  <div class='container'>
    <div class = 'center'>
      <iframe src="Prop_vs_Vio.html" width="550px" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>
    <div class='text'>
      <p>In this last polar bar chart, we are examining the difference between violent and property crimes
        month by month. The data for this plot was narrowed
        down to the years after 2020 as this category was not collected/input into the data regularly
        before then.
        We can see that in general property crimes are taking place at a much higher rate month
        over month(Avg ~1.5k for property, .7k for violent).
        Also, we can continue to observe the trend of more crimes being committed in summer
        months within both property and violent crime categories
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

  <p>
    In summary, we found that larger areas in Boston, particularly Dorchester, 
    Roxbury, and Downtown (with Chinatown having notably fewer crimes), tend to 
    experience more crime, which is relevant given their proximity to Northeastern 
    campus. We noticed that more crimes occur during the summer months, even when 
    college is out. Verbal assault was the most common crime type, followed by 
    incidents involving motor vehicles and vandalism. These findings emphasize 
    the need to understand crime patterns for improving safety measures in urban
     areas like Boston.
